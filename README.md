# Weather Forecasting Analysis


The document contains weather forecasting data analysis, including:

- Data loading from a CSV file.
- **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, such as displaying the dataset and its structure.
- **Graphs and models** related to weather parameters like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility.
- **Machine learning** techniques, possibly using sklearn for predictive modeling.

## Graph Description
- **The temperature trend** graph showcases seasonal fluctuations, with peaks during summer and troughs in winter. Humidity levels, plotted alongside temperature, reveal an inverse relationshipâ€”higher humidity is observed in colder months, while lower humidity coincides with higher temperatures.
- **The wind speed analysis** graph highlights fluctuations throughout the year, showing increased speeds during stormy periods, which directly impacts visibility levels.
- **Scatter plots** and correlation matrices indicate strong interdependencies between temperature, humidity, and pressure. Additionally, predictive model evaluation graphs, such as residual plots and error distributions, demonstrate how well machine learning models perform in forecasting weather conditions.

#### These visualizations provide actionable insights, aiding businesses and policymakers in making informed decisions.
